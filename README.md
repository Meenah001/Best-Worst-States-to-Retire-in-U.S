# Objective

This project objective was to give analysis on the best and worst states to retire in U.S. This was achieved by considering five factors which are as follows;

  i) Affordability
  ii) Weather
  iii) Wellness
  iv) Culture
  v) Crime
  
 AFFORDABILITY
 
Affordability is one of the key factors to consider when looking for places to retire. A must ask question by oneself is "Will I be able to afford this?, Will I be able to meet up with their cost of living?"  

 WEATHER

This is another factor to look into before concluding on which state to retire to, be sure you can cope with the weather condition of the chosen state before settling in.

 WELLNESS

Considering the wellness of a state is another thing to do findings on. Do a thorough investigation to know if there is any kind of disease/infection outbreak in such state. For instance, the case of COVID'19 pandemic, if the number of people that has been inflicted by the disease is so much in a state automatically such state is not suitable to retire to.

 CULTURE
The culture that is being practice in each state differs from one another, be so sure you can adapt to the culture of the state you want to retire to.

 CRIME

A state that has high records of crime can be deduce not to be a safe place to retire.

While analysing the data I noticed some questions need answers, some of the questions are;

  a) Which state is the best to retire in term of affordability?
  b) When considering the weather condition, which state has the best favourable weather?
  c) Wellness as a factor to consider in a state to retire, which state best meet up with this factor?

   # Findings
    
   After analysing the data I arrived at the conclusion that Georgia is the best state to retire, followed by Florida, Tennessee, Missouri and Wyoming. Why Georgia? The reason is not far fetch , Georgia happened to rank the 3rd in terms of affordability (which means it has a low cost of living, it cost of living is affordable),    4th in weather rank (This means it has a favourable weather condition)
